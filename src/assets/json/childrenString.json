    "summary": "<h5>The common string</h5><p> A string is said to has a common child with a another string if it can be formed the same string by deleting, one by one, the same characters on both strings (0 or more times). Letters cannot be rearranged. Given two strings of equal length, what's the longest common string that can be constructed? </p> <h6>Example</h6> <code> s1 = 'ABCD'\n s2 = 'ABDC' </code> <p> These strings have two children with maximum length: ABD. They can be formed by eliminating either the C from both strings. Return 3 . </p> <h6>Function Description</h6> <p> Complete the commonChild function in the editor below. commonChild has the following parameter(s): </p> <ul> <li>string s1: first string</li> <li>string s2: second string</li> </ul> <h6>Returns</h6> <ul> <li><em>int</em>: the length of the longest string which is a common child of the input strings</li> </ul> <h6>Input Format</h6> <p> There are two lines, each with a string, <em>s1</em> and <em>s2</em>.</p> <h6>Constraints</h6> <ul> <li>1 &leq; |s1|, |s2| &leq; 5000 where |s| means \"the length of \".</li> <li>All characters are upper case in the range ascii[A-Z].</li> </ul> <h6>Examples</h6> <h7>Sample Input 1</h7> <code> s1 = 'HARRY'\n s2 = 'SALLY' </code> <h7>Sample Output 1</h7> <p> 2</p> <h7>Explanation 1</h7> <p>The longest string that can be formed by deleting H,S,R,R from HARRY  and SALLY is AY , whose length is 2.</p> <h7>Sample Input 2</h7> <code> s1 = 'AA'\n s2 = 'BB' </code> <h7>Sample Output 2</h7><p> 0</p> <h7>Explanation 2</h7> <p>AA and BB have no characters in common and hence the output is 0.</p> <h7>Sample Input 3</h7> <code> s1 = 'SHINCHAN'\n s2 = 'NOHARAAA' </code> <h7>Sample Output 3</h7> <p> 3</p> <h7>Explanation 3</h7> <p> The longest string that can be formed between SHINCHAN  and NOHARAAA  while maintaining the order is NHA.</p> <h7>Sample Input 4</h7> <code> s1 = 'FBDAMN'\n s2 = 'BFNDMA' </code> <h7>Sample Output 4</h7> <p> 2</p> <h7>Explanation 4</h7> <p>BDA and BDM are the longest child of the given strings.</p>",
